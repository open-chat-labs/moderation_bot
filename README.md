This is the OpenChat moderation bot

... documentation to follow

## TODO

/configure command should allow to toggle between just platform rules, or platform & chat rules and allow config of consequences. For starters we will allow deleting the message or reacting to the message with a custom emoji.

Recording moderation events in some way to support reporting in some way. Probably we capture the content, the sender, the nature of the violation etc. Question is how do we store it. Need to think about how it is likely to be retrieved and how we need to control access to it.

Think about how we handle private contexts.
